      <description>If you ever thought about your childhood, you know how blurry the memory can be. One moment I am sure that some event happened, and the next, I can&amp;rsquo;t find any more details about it in my head. It is like I watched a video of my childhood, but it was a long time ago. And I am not really sure what happened, I can only notice the overall mood of my own childhood movie.</description>

      <description>Last week you asked how I find interesting new comics to read. Hmm, I am a professional comic book reader, as I like to say. What does that mean? I read comics even if I find them unappealing at first sight, and also if by my personal taste they belong to the basket labelled “Naah”.
But this wasn’t always like that. I think it all started when I was really young.</description>

      <description>SHORT COMIC STORY, the comic form that many believe it is hardest to make. There is a limited amount of pages (you can&amp;rsquo;t fit an action movie into 1-4 pages, or you can?).
Last week I was determined to make a short story, but as soon as I started thinking about the topic of the story, I gave up. If I couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide about the topic I want to draw, how could I come up with the story?</description>
