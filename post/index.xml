      <description>SHORT COMIC STORY - the comic form that many believe it is hardest to make. There is a limited amount of pages (you can&amp;rsquo;t fit an action movie into 1-4 pages, or you can?).
Last week I was determined to make a short story, but as soon as I started thinking about the topic of the story, I gave up. If I couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide about the topic I want to draw, how could I come up with the story?</description>

      <description>From January 16 to 23, the EESI joins FIBD and the ChiFouMi association to host the international Pierre Feuille Ciseaux workshop, led by Nicolas Verstappen, author and teacher at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok. It is a laboratory residence around experimental comics, which has been created and conducted many times in France and the United States. This year, 20 students from 10 international schools are invited to participate in this residency, in parallel with the residency which brings together professional authors, the same week and a few kilometres from AngoulÃªme.</description>
