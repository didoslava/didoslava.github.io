      <description>Last week you asked how I find interesting new comics to read. Hmm, I am a professional comic book reader, as I like to say. What does that mean? I read comics even if I find them unappealing at first sight, and also if by my personal taste they belong to the basket labelled “Naah”.
But this wasn’t always like that. I think it all started when I was really young.</description>

      <description>SHORT COMIC STORY, the comic form that many believe it is hardest to make. There is a limited amount of pages (you can&amp;rsquo;t fit an action movie into 1-4 pages, or you can?).
Last week I was determined to make a short story, but as soon as I started thinking about the topic of the story, I gave up. If I couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide about the topic I want to draw, how could I come up with the story?</description>

      <description>From January 16 to 23, the EESI joined FIBD and the ChiFouMi association to host the international Pierre Feuille Ciseaux workshop, led by Nicolas Verstappen, author and teacher at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok. It is a laboratory residence around experimental comics, which has been created and conducted many times in France and the United States. This year, 20 students from 10 international schools were invited to participate in this residency, in parallel with the residency which brings together professional authors, the same week and a few kilometres from Angoulême.</description>
