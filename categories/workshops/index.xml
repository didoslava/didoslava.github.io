      <description>From January 16 to 23, the EESI joined FIBD and the ChiFouMi association to host the international Pierre Feuille Ciseaux workshop, led by Nicolas Verstappen, author and teacher at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok. It is a laboratory residence around experimental comics, which has been created and conducted many times in France and the United States. This year, 20 students from 10 international schools were invited to participate in this residency, in parallel with the residency which brings together professional authors, the same week and a few kilometres from AngoulÃªme.</description>
