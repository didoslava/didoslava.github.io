      <description>Last week you asked how I find interesting new comics to read. Hmm, I am a professional comic book reader, as I like to say. What does that mean? I read comics even if I find them unappealing at first sight, and also if by my personal taste they belong to the basket labelled “Naah”.
But this wasn’t always like that. I think it all started when I was really young.</description>
